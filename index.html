<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>

<p style="line-height:30px;">This program uses the Visual Studios .net browser module to search the bing website. It then uses the DOM elements to click buttons and type in text boxes. Since every aspect of this program is self contained, we can use other options like hiding the browser window, minimizing the program and adjusting search speeds. Since this program is very simple in what it does I have released the source code.</p>
